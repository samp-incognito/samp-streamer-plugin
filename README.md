This plugin streams objects, pickups, checkpoints, race checkpoints, map icons, 3D text labels, and actors at user-defined server ticks. Basic area detection is also included. Because it is written entirely in C++, much of the overhead from PAWN is avoided. This streamer, as a result, is quite a bit faster than any other implementation currently available in PAWN.
