# SA-MP Streamer Plugin
[![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/samp-incognito/samp-streamer-plugin.svg)](https://github.com/samp-incognito/samp-streamer-plugin/releases/latest) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/samp-incognito/samp-streamer-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/samp-incognito/samp-streamer-plugin) [![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/samp-incognito/samp-streamer-plugin?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/samp-incognito/samp-streamer-plugin/branch/master)

This plugin streams objects, pickups, checkpoints, race checkpoints, map icons, 3D text labels, and actors at user-defined server ticks. Basic area detection is also included. Because it is written entirely in C++, much of the overhead from PAWN is avoided. This streamer, as a result, is quite a bit faster than any other implementation currently available in PAWN.
